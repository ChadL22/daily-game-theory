## Gameplay

In **Daily Game Theory**, a new game is presented to the player every day. The game selection is randomized from a pool of well-known game theory scenarios, each with unique rules and strategies. Your goal is to score points by making strategic decisions against a simulated opponent.

Each game presents a challenge based on game theory principles, with varying levels of difficulty. Players must carefully consider their choices to maximize their score over time.

## Game Types

Here is the current list of games available in **Daily Game Theory**:

1. **Prisoner's Dilemma**: Decide whether to cooperate or defect and see how your opponent responds.
2. **Battle of the Sexes**: Try to coordinate with your opponent to attend the same event (Opera vs. Football).
3. **Chicken (Hawk-Dove)**: Decide whether to act aggressively (Hawk) or passively (Dove) in a high-stakes showdown.
4. **Ultimatum Game**: Propose a split of a resource and see if your opponent accepts or rejects your offer.
5. **Trust Game**: Decide how much to send to your opponent, knowing it will be multiplied, and hope they return a fair amount.

More games will be added in future updates!
